    <p class="section-two__desc">Hello! I’m Poorani, a web developer with a passion for crafting user-friendly, visually appealing, and performance-driven websites. With a background in my relevant experience by handling smartschool webporatal managemnets, I specialize in delivering custom solutions that align with clients' goals and enhance user engagement. I believe in continuous learning, and I’m always exploring new technologies to improve my skills and deliver exceptional value.My journey in web development started with a curiosity about how websites worked, leading me to learn HTML and CSS as a hobby. That curiosity soon turned into a passion, and I dove deeper into the world of frontend and backend technologies. Over time, I’ve honed my skills through hands-on experience, continuous learning, and real-world projects that challenged me to grow.
       I’ve worked on various projects, from small business websites to dynamic web applications, collaborating with clients from different industries. Each project has taught me the importance of balancing functionality, aesthetics, and performance to deliver exceptional user experiences.</p>
